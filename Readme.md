# Lettuce

A less ugly frontend for [Lemmy](https://join-lemmy.org/), an awesome open source federated discussion platform.

## Why "Lettuce"?

Lettuce was named after:

- The green stuff healthy people eat
- Lemmy â†’ lemme (let me) â†’ let us â†’ Lettuce ðŸ˜Ž
- [A cool band.](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lettuce_(band)>) (don't sue me)

## Status

Currently I don't think I can get away with calling it anything more than a proof of concept.

I intend to keep working on it, but this is the side project of my side project, so don't hold your breath.
